# ArtSciLab Technical Documentation

This site serves as a central knowledge base for all things ArtSciLab. It's goals right now are to facilitate developer handoff when new students are hired, and provide a way to store new learnings that will be helpful in the future. 

## Guidelines for contributing articles to this site

- Keep an updated list of contributors in each article. 
- When speaking about a general procedure - use an example and walk through the process with that same example throughout the article.
- Use `code` when referring to UI elements that the reader might have to interact with. 
- Use `blockquotes` to define terms when there is jargon or technical language specific to the article you are working on. For example, in [Adding a subdomain](/server/addSubdomain.md), `reverse-proxy` is defined using a blockquote. 
- The general goal of each article should be to guide a user who knows what they are doing, but provide enough info to enable a novice to do it for the first time, following that guide. 
- When a link to a resource is possible, include it. 
- Watch out for edge cases and things that can go wrong, and warn the reader about them. If you had to deal with that issue yourself, include links to resources that helped you.
