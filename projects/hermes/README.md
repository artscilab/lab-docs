# HERMES
#### Highly Effective Research Merging Epistemic Systems


## About HERMES

Led by Alex Garc√≠a Topete, Project HERMES looks at how the collaboration between artists, designers, engineers, scientists, and other experts can boost innovation through shared tools and idea exchange, and tackle complex problems with creative solutions, ranging from the environment to new ways of learning to technology and society. 

It looks into how researchers and expert practitioners work together in interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary contexts, looking to clarify the paradigm(s) of transdisciplinary collaboration and draw out good practices and preventable pitfalls. By the end of the project, there will be a comprehensive report, multi-modal publications, and online transdisciplinary apprenticeship program.
