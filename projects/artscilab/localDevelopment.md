# Setting up local development for ArtSciLab

Local development has till now only involved the frontend. We have been making changes to the backend at [dev.atec.io](https://dev.atec.io) as needed, without a corresponding local installation, and just having the local frontend querying the same live API.

To get set up, you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed. Clone the [ArtSciLab repo](https://github.com/artscilab/artscilab) and run a `yarn install` to download all the dependencies. 

You should now be ready to go, just run `yarn dev` to get started with development. Peruse the [Next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) to get started. They have a pretty comprehensive [tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app) that is worth going through as well.
